The A-Team's Missouri COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker

This is a project made for the IS 241-Systems Analysis and Design class at Saint Louis Community College in Spring of 2021. 
It is designed for use at clinics administering COVID-19 vaccinations, allowing them to keep track of the patients and where/when they were given doses of the vaccines.
